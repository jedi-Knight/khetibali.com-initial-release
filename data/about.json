Despite being a predominantly agricultural country, people in Nepal—particularly the young generation, aged between 10 and 24, which constitutes 33% of the total population—do not choose agriculture as their preferred profession and do not work in countryside. Rather, they prefer to move to urban centers in search of better life. This results into in two major problems: decrease in agricultural productivity and over-crowded urban centers with significant challenges to manage. </p>",

After discussing it with schools, we have identified that it nicely fits into existing Social Studies curriculum of grades IX and X.<ul><li>Since mapping activities will be carried in the context of agriculture and food security, we believe that students will consciously observe, inquire, reflect and enhance their knowledge in agriculture.<li><li>Agriculture and food security data will be open to public in OpenStreetMap. Additionally, we will also create a separate website with custom map visualization of agricultural data. This will make farmers’ products visible to market. Such visualization might also motivate other youth to engage in agriculture.</li></ul>"
